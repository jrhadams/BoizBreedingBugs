# Boiz Breeding Bugs

This repository is a collection of a **subset** of notes which pertain to breeding insects for human & animal consumption. 

Despite the title, anyone can partake in this discussion through the [Obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin. To be sure that you don't sync personal notes here, you will have to write all :bug: content in a folder called /bbb/.
